                                with. When I assumed the role of technical lead of the Porch Services Migration team at
                                Porch, I was tasked with mentoring the team in a new tech stack. Pratik picked it up
                                faster than anyone I've ever met (myself included). Every task I gave him resulted in
                                work that exceeded my expectations, and on more than one occassion, Pratik would correct
                                my own mistakes. He proactively engaged with individuals across teams when solving
                                problems, which resulted in lasting inter-team relationships. The benefits were apparent
                                in Pratik's robust solutions which integrated smoothly with the work of other teams and
                                facilitated the quick delivery of new and high quality features. Anyone would be lucky
                                to have him.</p>
